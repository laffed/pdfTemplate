        <p>You have elected to receive your flood claim payment(s) via EFT directly into your bank account. In order to receive your claim payment(s) by EFT, <span class="text_BoldUnderline">you must have:</span></p><br>
        <ul class="unorderedLi">
          <li> A valid active checking account with a U.S. based bank;</li>
          <li> A valid active email account;</li>
          <li> An active cell phone number that accepts text messaging and;</li>
          <li> Access to the internet. (A gaming system such as Xbox, PlayStation, etc. will not work)</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>In order to receive your funds, you must successfully enroll in this program by following the below steps.</p>
        <div class="paragraphGrid"><span class="bold_text">1.</span>
          <p>After you have submitted a completed Advance Payment Request Form (below), you will receive an enrollment email with <span class="text_BoldUnderline">the Subject line "Selective Flood Claim Payment Information". This email will be from Selective Flood@vpayusa.com. </span>The enrollment email will be sent to the email address provided in the Advance Payment Request Form 
            within approximately 3 business days following Selective's review of documentation from the
            adjusting firm. This time frame may be expanded during a large flooding event. Remember to check your "junk" and/or "spam‚Äù folder for this email.
          </p><span class="bold_text">2.</span>
          <p>Upon your receipt of the enrollment email, click on the link in the email to begin the enrollment process. <span class="text_bold">You will be given 3 days from your receipt to successfully complete enrollment. </span>If for any reason you are unable to complete the EFT enrollment process, the emailed link will become inactive after 3 days and your claim payment 
            check will be mailed to the mailing address shown on your policy.
          </p><span class="bold_text">3.</span>
          <p>
             After clicking the link, you will be required to create a password. Password creation instructions will be provided online. Next, to help verify identity, a text message 
            containing a 6-digit code will be sent to the cell phone number provided on the Advance Payment Request Form. <span class="text_bold">You must enter this code into the webpage within 5 minutes of receipt. </span>If a valid code is not successfully entered within 3 attempts, your claim payment check will be
            mailed to the mailing address shown on your policy.
          </p><span class="bold_text">4.</span>
          <p>
            After verifying your identity, you will be taken to the Terms & Conditions screen for review and acknowledgement. Next you will need to enter your bank routing and 
            checking account numbers. <span class="text_bold">You will have 3 attempts to enter a valid routing and account number. </span>If you do not enter valid information after 3 attempts, the emailed link 
            will become inactive and your claim payment check will be mailed to the mailing address shown on your policy.
          </p><span class="bold_text">5.</span>
          <p>If the information is entered successfully, you will be taken to a confirmation screen and a confirmation email will be sent to you with a summary of the payment timing and details.</p><span class="bold_text">6.</span>
